        <strong>Bold text</strong>

        <p class="red">
            With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected
            figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on <em>June 1, 1937</em> in <a href="#">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a
            teacher, and <a href="#">Morgan Porterfield Freeman</a>, a barber. The young Freeman attended <strong>Los Angeles City College</strong> before
            serving several years in the <a href="#">US Air Force</a> as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure
            was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.

        <p class="green">
            Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including "Easy Reader", "Mel Mounds" and "Count Dracula" on the
            Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show <span style="color: green">The Electric Company</span> (1971). He then moved into feature
            film with another children's adventure, Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role
            in the thriller <span class="unseen" >Blade</span> (1973); then he played Casca in <span class="unseen" >Julius Caesar</span> (1979) and the title role in Coriolanus (1979).

            (1980), Eyewitness (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain <span>Malcolm X</span> in Death of a Prophet (1981).
            For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in
            their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an <a href="http://oscar.go.com/"      target="_blank">Oscar</a> nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart
            (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second <a class="red" href="http://oscar.go.com/"    target="_blank">Oscar</a> nomination in the film version of <a class="unseen" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097239/" target="movies">Driving Miss
            Daisy (1989)</a> opposite <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001788/">Jessica Tandy</a>. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery
            Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama <a class="seen" href="pages/glory.html">Glory (1989)</a> about freed slaves being recruited to form the first
            all-African American fighting brigade.
